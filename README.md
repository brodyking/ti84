ti84 plus ce (python) modification guide for new os versions.

## steps

Download the [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) app and drag all the files to the calculator, then unplug.

- On the ti-84, navigate through ```apps``` > ```CabirJr``` > ```y=``` > ```Open..``` > ```*ARTIFICE``` > ```Cesium``` > ```del```
- Then goto ```apps``` > ```Cesium```

## more info

- ```clibs.8xg``` is used for some c-libraries that are no longer included.
- ```arTIfiCE.8xv``` is used for brining back ASM to newer os versions after TI removed it.
- ```cesium``` is used as a application manager of sorts. just makes it a lil easier so you dont need to do the whole cabirjr thing again.
